This dataset contains customer information for a segmentation analysis using K-Means clustering. It includes spending habits, purchase frequency, and average order value.

Dataset Description
Column Name	Description
CustomerID	Unique identifier for each customer
AnnualSpending	Total amount spent by the customer annually (in currency)
PurchaseFrequency	Number of purchases made by the customer per year
AvgOrderValue	Average value per purchase made by the customer

Objective
The goal is to perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. This helps in identifying distinct groups of customers for targeted marketing strategies.

Steps to Run Clustering

python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

# Step 1: Load Data
df = pd.read_csv("customer_data.csv")

# Step 2: Select features
X = df[['AnnualSpending', 'PurchaseFrequency', 'AvgOrderValue']]

# Step 3: Apply KMeans Clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(X)
df['Cluster'] = kmeans.labels_

# Step 4: Visualize Results in 3D
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
scatter = ax.scatter(df['AnnualSpending'], df['PurchaseFrequency'], df['AvgOrderValue'],
                     c=df['Cluster'], cmap='viridis', s=100)
ax.set_xlabel('Annual Spending')
ax.set_ylabel('Purchase Frequency')
ax.set_zlabel('Avg Order Value')
ax.set_title('Customer Clustering (K-Means)')
plt.colorbar(scatter)
plt.show()
Insights You Can Extract
High-value customers with high spending and frequent purchases

Low-engagement customers with fewer purchases and lower spending

Outliers or special segments (e.g., low frequency but high order value)

Output
Cluster: The assigned cluster label for each customer
