# T20-Data-Analysis
I recently completed a project where I utilized Power BI to analyze T20 cricket player data and select the top 11 players for a team. To gather the required data, 
I employed the Brightdata website tool to scrape data from espncricinfo. Once I had the data, I used pandas to clean and transform it, ensuring its suitability for analysis.
With the data ready, I proceeded to evaluate various player performance metrics. This step was crucial in identifying the top players for different categories such as openers,
middle order/anchors, finishers, all-rounders, and specialist fast bowlers. By leveraging the capabilities of Power BI,
I was able to create an intuitive dashboard that presented these metrics in a visually appealing manner.
The Power BI dashboard proved to be an invaluable tool in the player selection process. I used it to assess the performance metrics and make informed decisions about which players to include in each category.
Taking into account all the factors, I carefully picked the top 11 players for the match.
Based on my analysis and the team selected using the Power BI dashboard, I am confident that our chances of winning the game are as high as 90%. 
The data-driven approach and comprehensive analysis provided by Power BI greatly increased the accuracy and reliability of my player selection process.
I am excited about the potential of Power BI in sports analytics, and this project has reinforced its effectiveness in making informed decisions.
I am proud of the outcome and look forward to applying similar techniques in future projects.
